                                            <p><font size = +1> It is so great to meet you. Thank you for visiting my website. I am so excited for you to see my work but, before that, let me properly introduce myself.  </font></p> 
                                            <p><font size = +1> I am currently in my fourth year of professional writing at York University and, to put it simply, I love it here. I have learned so much about writing, who I am, and who I can be as a writer. I honestly am so excited to apply what I have learned to my future, I just have yet to figure out how to do that. </font></p>
                                            <p><font size = +1> In the future, I hope to be a lawyer. My ultimate goal is to transfer the skills that I have learned in this program to my future career in a way that is meaningful. I have learned so much and I know that I have become a better writer for it. I hope to be able to express that in my work some day. </font></p>
                                            <p><font size = +1> For the most part, that sums up who I am. Outside of my work as a student and a digital author, I am just another 21-year-old who likes to write, watch scary movies, go out with her friends, and live my life to the fullest.</font></p>
                                            <p><font size = +1>
