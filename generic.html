										<h2>Welcome to my portfolio</h2>
									</header>
									<p>During my time in the professional writing program at York University, I have had several opportunities to create work that I am extremely proud of. Beyond that, being on the Founders College Student Council at York has given me the chance to do a lot of social media and website-making based work which I love. Below, I have linked some of the work that I have done which an idea of what each piece is and the background behind it. These pieces best represent who I am as a digital author and I am very excited to share them with you. </p>

												<h3>The Writer Who Hates Writing</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In my third year Substantive Editing course, we were given an assignment for which we were to writer about anything that we cared about a lot. There were practically no limits when it came to the topic, the format, and the process. With this freedom to write anything, I wrote about how I lost my drive as a student and as a writer. After completing it, my professor offered me the opportunity to present it at the Professional Writing Students' Association's Annual Symposium. I took a chance and it was such an incredible experience that led to me officially being a published writer. </p> <p> This piece is one that means a lot to me and I hope you like it!  </p>

												<h3>Founders College Student Council Website</h3>
											</header>
											<p>At York University, students are split into colleges based on their programs from the very beginning of their undergrad degree. Being in the professoinal writing program meant being a part of Founders College and attending orientation week as a Founders constituent in my first year. I have been a part of the Founders community and it has been the experience of a lifetime. I have gone from being someone who would just hang out in their lounge, to the being the Founders College Board Director with our student union, to one of the orientation chairs for the 2022 Frosh Week, to being the current Vice-President of Operations on the Founders student council. </p> <p> As the VP of Operations, I was asked to create the website for our student council. It took some time but eventually, I was able to create something that we are proud of as a council and that made our head office proud as well. </p><p> This college has meant so much to me in the last few years and I love that I was able to create this year's website using Squarespace to showcase our future merchandise, the frosh week we put on, and more! Beyond that, I love that I am able to share it as part of my portfolio.</p>

												<h3>Video Essay</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This one is definitely hard to share (especially since I was still rocking the side-part) but it is the start of this whole journey. In my third year digital authoring course, we were asked to create a video essay that reflected how we work as writers; something that would capture what our workflow looked like. I created a video essay that looked at how much I procrastinate and how I don't believe that procrastination is as bad as people think it is. It isn't very long and it might be a little bit rough, but it means a lot to me. It was the beginning of my digital authoring journey and, more than that, it was one of the projects that made me realize why I loved writing in the first place.</p>
